# Sets https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sets-in-python/
# Sets in Python
# A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable,
# mutable and has no duplicate elements. Pythonâ€™s set class represents the
# mathematical notion of a set. The major advantage of using a set,
# as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for
# checking whether a specific element is contained in the set.
# This is based on a data structure known as a hash table.
# Since sets are unordered, we cannot access items using indexes
# like we do in lists.

# Remove an item by value remove()
odd_numbers.remove(3)

set1 = {"Joe","John","Jeff","Sally","Sue"}

# Intersection operator, similar to inner joinn
print(set1 & set2)
print(set1.intersection(set2))

# Union (members of each set)
print(set1 | set2)
print(set1.union(set2))

# Difference between the two sets
print(set1 ^ set2)
print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))

# Set comprehension
# Format like {expression for expression in iterable}
# It can have the optional condition tests {expression for expression in iterable if condition}
